            ! errors observed on whale when running with 64 images
            !
            ! when running with niter>3 and last_image=50, it will hang
            ! during one of the writes/reads for GASNet IBV (turn off
            ! GASNET_VIS_AMPIPE to prevent this, but that results in
            ! worse performance)
            !
            ! when running with niter=50 and last_image=11, it exits
            ! abnormally when using GASNet IBV (not all the processes
            ! call MPI_Finalize for some reason).
            !
            ! the bugs seem related. in both cases, using IBV conduit,
            ! using strided transfers, and using GASNET_VIS_AMPIPE=1.
            ! The termination error seems to occur for different sizes
            ! of N, though its more likely to occur with large N. the
            ! hanging error looks to be much more predictable.
            !
            ! possible solution is to handle the AM packing/unpacking
            ! for non-contiguous transfers myself rather than relying on
            ! GASNET_VIS_AMPIPE.
