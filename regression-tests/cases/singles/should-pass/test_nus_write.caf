! Non-Unit Stride Write Test

! This tests support for non-unit strided write accesses. This entails the use
! of subscripts with explicit strides. Here, image 1 does a non-unit stride write
! access to image 2, and then image 2 prints ths contents of the array
! that was written to.


      program test_nus_write
        integer, allocatable :: a(:,:)[:]

        allocate ( a(10,10)[*] )

        a = this_image()

        if (this_image() == 2) then
          print *, "printing a on image 2 ..."
          do i=1,10
            print *, a(i,:)
          end do
          call flush(6)
        end if


        sync all

        if (this_image() == 1) then
          a(1:10:3, 1:10:2)[2] = -1000
        end if

        sync all

        if (this_image() == 2) then
          print *, "printing a on image 2 (after update) ..."
          do i=1,10
            print *, a(i,:)
          end do
          call flush(6)
        end if

        deallocate(a)
