! Event Feature Test

! This is a test for the proposed events language feature. Image 1 posts an
! event to every other image. The other images wait for the event to be posted
! to them, and then continues.

      program main
        use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env
        implicit none

        type( event_type ) :: ev[*]
        integer :: a[*]
        integer :: b
        integer :: i
        integer :: me

        a = 0
        me = this_image()

        sync all

        if (me == 1) then
          do i=2,num_images()
            a[i] = i
            event post ( ev[i] )
            call sleep(1)
          end do
          b = 1
        else
            event wait ( ev )
            b = a
        end if

        if (b /= this_image()) then
            print *, me, " FAILURE: b = ", b
        else
            print *, me, " SUCCESS"
        end if


      end program
