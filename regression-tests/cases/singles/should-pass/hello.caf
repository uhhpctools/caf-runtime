! Hello Test

! A basic coarray test. Image 1 writes to arr on image 2. Then each image
! prints its image ID and its value of arr.

            program hello
            integer  ::arr(3)[*],num
            arr(:) = this_image()
            sync all
            if(this_image()==1) then
                num=2
                arr(2)=3
                arr(3)=4
                arr(:)[num]=arr(:)[this_image()]
            end if

            sync all

            print * , "Hello, this is image ",this_image()
            print * , arr(:)

            end program hello
