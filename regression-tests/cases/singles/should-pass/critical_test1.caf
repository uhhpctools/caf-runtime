! Critical Section Test

! This is a basic correctness test for critical section. Only one image may !
! execute the critical section at the same time.

      program critical_test1
          integer :: me
          integer :: counter[*]
          integer :: check(2)

          me = this_image()

          critical
            check(1) = counter[1]

            check(2) = counter[1]

            counter[1] = counter[1] + 1

            print *, "check: ", check(1), check(2)
          end critical


      end program
