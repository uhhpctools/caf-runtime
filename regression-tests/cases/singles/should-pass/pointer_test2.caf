! Pointer Test 2

! Test functionality of a pointer component of a coarray being associated with
! a local array target. Because b is not a coarray, the access here entails
! accessing an array that may not be have been allocated within the runtime's shared
! memory segment. We can handle this in GASNet using AM, but the ARMCI
! implementation of the runtime does not support this at this time.

        program main
          implicit none

          type T1
              integer :: x, y, z
              integer, pointer :: p(:)
          end type

          integer, parameter :: N = 10
          integer, target :: b(N)
          integer, target :: c(N)[*]
          type(T1)        :: a[*]
          integer         :: iam
          integer         :: i

          iam = this_image()

          b(:) = (/ ( 10*iam+i, i=1,N ) /)

          a%p => b

          c = iam

          sync all

          if (iam == 1) then
              print *, " a[1]%p(:) = ",   a[1]%p(:)
              print *, " a[2]%p(:) = ",   a[2]%p(:)
              print *, " a[3]%p(:) = ",   a[3]%p(:)
              print *, " a[4]%p(:) = ",   a[4]%p(:)

              a[3]%p(:) = 1000
              a[4]%p(:) = 1000
              a[1]%p(::2) = 500
              a[2]%p(::2) = 500
              a[3]%p(::2) = 500
              a[4]%p(::2) = 500
          end if

          sync all
