README for UH CAF Regression Test Suite.

### Introduction ###

This testsuite, or more appropriately, regression testsuite is meant to be
comprised of bits of code that elicit either compile time bugs or runtime bugs
in OpenUH CAF implementation. Any code found cause an error in either
compiliation or execution of the resulting binary (or use of library) should
be preserved in this testing frame work to ensure that the presence of such
bugs can be detected in future versions of OpenUH.

### Introduction ###

Coarray Fortran (CAF) single-file test cases are added in regression-tests/cases/singles/

### Quick Start - How To Run Tests ###

To run only the CAF test suite, make sure the OpenUH compilers is installed
with coarray support.

For compiling, type:
regression-tests$ make compile-tests

For executing, type:
regression-tests$ make execute-tests

### How To Add A Test ###

Step 1: Put the file(s) in the appropriate place for Type:

* Type 1: a single source file testing for correct behavior
	Place single source file into: regression-tests/cases/singles/caf/should-pass

* Type 2: a single source file testing incorrect code which should fail
	Place single source file into: regression-tests/cases/singles/caf/should-fail

* Type 3: a single source file testing a compilation issue(s)
	Place single source file into: regression-tests/cases/singles/caf/bugs

* Type 4: a multi source file testing a compilation issue(s)
	Place multi source file into: TBD

* Type 5: a mult source file testing for expected runtime behavior
	Place multi source file into: TBD

Step 2: Run the test using 4 images, and add the sorted output file in
${regression-tests}/output/CAF-should-pass. The output file should have the format
<file>.caf.x.t=4.out.  Example: for new testcase a.caf:

    uhcaf a.caf -o a.caf.x
    cafrun -n 4 a.caf.x > out
    sort out > a.caf.x.t=4.out
    mv a.caf.x.t=4.out ${regression-tests}/output/CAF-should-pass
