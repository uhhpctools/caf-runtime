INSTALLING AND USING the UH CAF RUNTIME
---------------------------------------

This source package can be used to build and install the Coarray Fortran
Runtime library used by the OpenUH CAF compiler. It will also install scripts
for compiling and launching CAF programs (uhcaf and cafrun, respectively).

The runtime has dependencies to other communication libraries (GASNet, ARMCI,
MPI) that may reside on your system, so we provide the source separately in
case the you are using a prebuilt OpenUH compiler without CAF runtime
included. Note that if you download the OpenUH source code, it will also
include the source code for the CAF runtime so this package will not be
necessary.

To build the runtime from source, you follow a similar procedure as when
building OpenUH. That is, create a build directory, and from there run
configure, make, and make install.

When configuring, you may specify location of GASNet and/or ARMCI installation
(these are the currently supported runtimes that provide 1-sided communication
plus other features). The UH CAF runtime is compatible with GASNet version >=
1.18.2 and ARMCI version >= 5.0. Both these libraries also require MPI to be
installed on the system.

GASNet source download:
    http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu/#download

ARMCI source download (part of Global Array Toolkit):
    http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/global/download.shtml

Here's an example for building the CAF runtime to work with either GASNet or
ARMCI:

    [caf-runtime-src]$ mkdir build
    [caf-runtime-src]$ cd build
    [caf-runtime-bld]$ ../configure --prefix=/path/to/openuh/install \
                  --with-gasnet-root=/path/to/gasnet/installation \
                  --with-armci-root=<armci-install-path> \
                  --with-armci-network-libs=<additional linker args>
    [caf-runtime-bld]$ make
    [caf-runtime-bld]$ make install


Minimally, to compile a CAF program:

    $ uhcaf my_program.caf -o my_program

To run the CAF program on 8 images:

    $ cafrun -n 8 ./my_program

Run uhcaf --help and cafrun --help for further options.
